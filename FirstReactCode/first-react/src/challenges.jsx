Challenge - recreate the above line of code in vanilla JS by creating and
appending an h1 to our div#root (without using innerHTML).

- Create a new h1 element (createElement)
- Give it some textContent
- Give it a class name of "header"
- append it as a child (using `appendChild`) of the div#root

Don't use innerHTML to accomplish any of this. (Imperative coding)

Part 2: 
- Add a `<header>` element with an `<img />` element with the image of the 
  React logo inside (src="react-logo.png") and make sure to set the 
  width to something more manageable so it doesn't take up the whole screen.
  Also, as always, you should include some alt text on the image.
- Add an `<h1>` with some text describing the page. (E.g. "Reasons
  I'm excited to learn React"). Place it above the ordered list, then wrap
  the `<h1>` and `<ol>` inside a `<main>` element to keep our semantic
  structure flowing well.
- Add a `<footer>` after the list that says:
